# Scheduling Theory

This repository contains code implementations of various scheduling algorithms, used in operations research, computer science, and project management.

## Algorithms Implemented

Currently, the repository contains the following implementations:

- [Critical Path Method (CPM)](./CPM/)
- [Project Evaluation and Review Technique](./PERT/)

The Critical Path Method (CPM) is a project modeling technique used in project management to identify critical and non-critical tasks and prevent schedule conflicts and bottlenecks.

To get started with the CPM, navigate to the [CPM directory](./CPM/).

The Project Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) is a statistical tool used in project management, designed to analyze and represent the tasks involved in completing a given project. It provides a graphical representation of a project's timeline that allows project managers to identify the critical path of tasks that directly impact the project completion time.

To get started with PERT, navigate to the PERT [directory](./PERT/).

## Getting Started

To run the code in this repository, you will need Python installed on your machine. You can download Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Once you have Python installed, clone this repository to your local machine and navigate into the desired directory.
